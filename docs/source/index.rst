**Cool-chic** (pronounced :gray:`/kul  Éik/` as in French ü•ñüßÄüç∑) is a
low-complexity neural image codec based on overfitting. It offers image coding
performance competitive with H.266/VVC for 2000 multiplications per decoded
pixel.


Cool-chic 3.2 improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **Fast CPU-only decoder** as proposed in `Overfitted image coding at reduced
  complexity, Blard et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11651>`_

  * Decode a 512x768 image in **100 ms**
  * C API for **binary arithmetic coding**

* Encoding (*i.e.* training) time **reduced by 35%**

* **Rate reduction of 5%** compared to Cool-chic 3.1.


Check-out the `release history
<https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Cool-Chic/releases>`_ to see previous
versions of Cool-chic.

.. attention::

   üõë Cool-chic 3.2 temporarily disables video coding. If you really want to
   compress videos you can

   * Go back to 3.1: ``git clone --branch v3.1
     https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Cool-Chic.git``

   * Wait for Cool-chic 4.0 for better and faster video coding üòâ.
