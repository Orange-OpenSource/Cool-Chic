Image coding performance
========================

We provide comprehensive experimental results demonstrating the compression
performance of Cool-chic, its low decoding complexity and the associated
encoding complexity.

We also provide some already encoded bitstreams in ``samples/bitstream/`` so
that everybody can decode them to try out our fast CPU-only neural decoder.
